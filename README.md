# django_rss_scraper
 simple RSS scraper application which saves RSS feeds to a database and lets a user view and manage feeds theyâ€™ve added to the system through an API.

## Features

- A user of this API should be able to:
    - Follow and unfollow multiple feeds
    - List all feeds registered by them
    - List feed items belonging to one feed
    - Mark items as read
    - Filter read/unread feed items per feed and globally (e.g. get all unread items from all feeds or one feed in particular). Order the items by the date of the last update
    - Force a feed update
- Feeds (and feed items) should be updated asynchronously in the background.
- Implement a back-off mechanism for feed fetching
- If a feed fails to be updated, the system should fall back for a while.
- After a certain amount of failed tries, the system should stop updating the feed automatically.
- Users should be notified and able to retry the feed update if it is stalled after these failed tries.
